This is another wiring adapter for classic CMRI boards.  This one is for the CMRINet (RS485) line.  It plugs onto the 5 pin
male molex header (0.156) and brings out 2 sets of 0.100" (2.54mm) or 3.5mm pads for connection to the CMRINet.  This allows
connection without terminating a molex cable.  Note the spacing too tight for two on an SMINI so I've included two sets of screw 
terminals to support the daisy chain.
